ANDROID APP DONE DURING SUMMER INTERNSHIP

This App displays the machinery status in vishakapatnam port on real time data either input by POs in shift through this app  or through website by admin on request.

I added the login functionality ,it allows all employees to login but only a selected few to edit the content for example: shift POs.
This functionality reduces visiting database through Myphpadmin for editing whenever their is a change to be updated.

for more info:
check documentation and ppt available in screenshots folder.
